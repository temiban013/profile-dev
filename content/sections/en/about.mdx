With over 20 years of experience in software engineering, I bring a unique blend of enterprise application development experience and modern web technology expertise. My career has evolved from early programming with DBase IV during military service to architecting complex digital solutions for major corporations like Disney Parks and Office Depot.

My technical foundation in .NET Core and C# has expanded to embrace contemporary development stacks, with recent projects leveraging Next.js, TypeScript, and blockchain technologies. I specialize in bridging traditional enterprise systems with cutting-edge technologies, having successfully led numerous digital transformation initiatives.
